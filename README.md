# xvsc

xvsc contains my personal configurations, theme, and the extensions I've developed for VS Code.

xvsc stands for "extras for vsc".

## Projects in this repo

### [Trailscasts](./trailscasts)

A Dark UI theme inspired by Railscasts.

### [Find Word At Cursor](./findWordAtCursor)

Use keyboard shortcuts to jump through occurrences of the word or selection under cursor.

### [Simple Autocomplete](./simpleAutocomplete)

Fewer keystrokes, no-nonsense autocomplete that cycles through matches based on fuzzy word search performed on the open document(s). This is like IntelliJ's Cyclic Expand Word or NetBeans Hippie Completion.

### [Find-Jump](./findJump)

Like Ace Jump but with a flow such as:

Keyboard shortcut ➡ Type a few letters to find matches ➡ Jump

### [Smarter Selection](./smarterSelection) (planned)

Like VS Code built-in smart selection feature, but with better abstract syntax trees.

### [vie](https://github.com/msafi/vie)

vie allows you to quickly view pull-requests or browse other codebases in VS Code (or any text editor, really). It can come in handy if you do a lot of that.

### Other content

I also put my [`settings.json`](./configs/settings.json), [`keybindings.json`](./configs/keybindings.json), [code snippets](./xvscSnippets/snippets), and other [miscellaneous bits and pieces of functionality](./xvscMisc) in this repo.
